title: "Why I Am Studying Probability Before Deep Learning"

## Motivation

Most students jump directly into neural networks without understanding probability theory.

## What I Realized

Machine learning models are fundamentally probabilistic systems.  
Without understanding distributions, expectation, and variance, model behavior feels magical rather than mathematical.

## What I Am Studying

- Random variables  
- Expectation and variance  
- Conditional probability  
- Law of large numbers  

## Reflection

Building reliable AI systems requires mathematical clarity, not just framework familiarity.
